# 🔐 Password Strength Checker using Python & Tkinter
This is a simple GUI-based Password Strength Checker built using Python and Tkinter. It evaluates a password based on specific criteria such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters — and gives real-time feedback on its strength.

---

🚀 Features
-Real-time strength evaluation

Checks for:

-Minimum length

-Uppercase & lowercase letters

-Digits

-Special characters

-Simple and user-friendly GUI

-No asterisk masking – visible password input (optional)

---

🛠️ How It Works
-The checker evaluates the password based on these rules:

-Length ≥ 8 characters

-Contains at least one uppercase letter

-Contains at least one lowercase letter

-Contains at least one digit

-Contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:'",.<>/?)

The strength is rated as:

❌ Weak

⚠️ Medium

✅ Strong
